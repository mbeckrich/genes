<p>A text  exists  in what Borges calls an infinite dialogue with its recipients, and its  endless  recontextualization  guarantees that  even  without  a  mark of difference every book, page, and even letter can differ from themselves. Our libraries do not fall short of universality because of a character weâ€™ve left out, but because totality itself is essentially incomplete.</p>
