It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people - it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women - who engage in it compulsively and without joy. Yes, Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.

*Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with -- do you have any Kahl√∫a?*
