H. Jon Benjamin was so named after J.R.R. Tolkien's grandfather: Tolkien, John Benjamin.

In 2025, H. Jon Benjamin was cast as Roger Lea McBride[^1].

> While Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote the Little House books, it was Rose Wilder Lane who edited them and it was Lane who had the rights after Wilder's death. Rose was an "outspoken antigovernment polemicist and is called one of the grandmothers of the libertarian movement."[5] Lane's views were supported by her mother.[6] Despite her mother's support of her political views, Lane went against her mother and what was written in her will by leaving the rights of the Little House books to Roger Lea MacBride after her own death.[6] Roger Lea MacBride has strong connections to politics, being a once libertarian presidential candidate, and a member of the Republican Liberty Caucus.[5]
