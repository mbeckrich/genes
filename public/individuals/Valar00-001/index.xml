      <description>Rutledge writes that in The Lord of the Rings, and especially at moments like Gandalf&#39;s explanation to Frodo in &amp;quot;The Shadow of the Past&amp;quot;, there are clear hints of a higher power at work in events in Middle-earth:
There was more than one power at work, Frodo. The Ring was trying to get back to its master ... Behind that there was something else at work, beyond any design of the Ring-maker.</description>
