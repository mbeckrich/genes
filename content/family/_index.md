{{% individual %}}
Rather than focus on the traditional nuclear family, this page uses an [Ahnentafel-like](https://www.tamurajones.net/AhnenChaos.xhtml) method to combine individuals into more meaningful groups. Genealogy will often focus on a mother, father, and children they might have as a single group, but this makes it difficult to tell stories and understand families based on the units they often truly operate as -- for example, the two brothers and cousin who learned photography together while cataloging their time stationed in just-liberated France. Tolkien, John Ronald Reuel.
